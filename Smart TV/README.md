Follow the steps in \href{https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/get-started-pico-w/0}{"Getting started with your Raspberry Pi Pico W"} to install MicroPython onto the Pi Pico W and set up the Thonny Python IDE. Open \href{https://github.com/ECE-492-SALE/SALE_ECE491-02/blob/main/Smart%20TV/main.py}{main.py}  in Thonny and save the file to your computer. Edit the section labeled "Internet Credentials" to the Wi-Fi credentials and Roku IP address of your own system. Save this modified program to your pico by selecting File, Save As, Raspberry Pi Pico. Before you click OK, ensure that the file name is "main.py", which may require overwriting an existing main.py file. This will allow the program to start up as soon as the Pico receives power.
